# Informative MPPI (I-MPPI) Examples

Examples of informative control for exploration and mapping.

- `simulation.py`: Full simulation of the two-layer I-MPPI architecture (Zhang et al. 2020), combining global path planning with local informative reactivity.
- `fsmi_grid_demo.py`: Visualizes the Fast Shannon Mutual Information (FSMI) calculation on occupancy grids.
